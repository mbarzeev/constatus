Constatus
=========

What Is It?
-----------
Constants are great, right?
But for some odd reason developers think that when it comes to JS there is no need for them.
Not using Constants results in source code which has a lot of Strings flying around, which later make the maintenance of it a painful task.
There are many ways to introduce Constants to JS, but the hard thing to do is to find and detect all these places using Strings where constants are in due, and this is what this little tool is going to help you with.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have node installed on you machine.
3. Run: 

	npm install

4. run the tool like so (sample configuration can be found on the conf directory):

	node constatus.js &lt;your configuration file&gt;

5. the results should appear swiftly
